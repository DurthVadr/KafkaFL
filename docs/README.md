## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive federated learning system using Apache Kafka as the communication backbone. The system supports both synchronous and asynchronous federated learning approaches, with a focus on scalability, reliability, and ease of deployment.

### Key Features

- **Multiple Deployment Options**: Docker-based and local development setups
- **Flexible Architecture**: Support for both sync and async federated learning
- **Advanced Model Support**: LeNet and custom CNN architectures for CIFAR-10
- **Robust Communication**: Kafka-based messaging with automatic reconnection
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and visualization
- **Weight Adaptation**: Automatic handling of model architecture differences
- **Resource Optimization**: Memory-efficient operation with configurable limits
- **Flower Integration**: Comparison and benchmarking against Flower framework

### Use Cases

- **Research**: Academic research in federated learning algorithms
- **Edge Computing**: Distributed learning across edge devices
- **Privacy-Preserving ML**: Training without centralizing sensitive data
- **IoT Applications**: Learning from distributed sensor networks
- **Mobile Applications**: Federated learning on mobile devices
