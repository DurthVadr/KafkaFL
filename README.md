# Federated Learning with Kafka

This project implements a federated learning system using Kafka as the communication layer between clients and a server. The server manages a global model, while clients train the model on their local datasets and send updates back to the server.

## Overview

Federated Learning is a machine learning approach where multiple clients (e.g., mobile devices, edge devices) train a shared model while keeping their data local. This implementation uses Kafka as the communication infrastructure to enable scalable and reliable message passing between the server and clients.

## Project Structure

### Core Components
- `server.py`: Implements the `FederatedServer` class, which manages the global model and coordinates updates from clients.
- `client.py`: Implements the `FederatedClient` class, which trains a local model on the CIFAR-10 dataset and communicates with the server.

### Common Modules
- `common/model.py`: Defines model architectures for CIFAR-10 classification, including a standard CNN and LeNet.
- `common/data.py`: Handles loading and preprocessing the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- `common/serialization.py`: Provides utilities for serializing and deserializing model weights.
- `common/kafka_utils.py`: Contains functions for Kafka communication.
- `common/logger.py`: Implements a custom logging system with colored output.

### Deployment
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the Docker configuration for running Kafka, the server, and multiple clients.
- `Dockerfile.server`: Docker configuration for the server.
- `Dockerfile.client`: Docker configuration for the clients.

### Utilities
- `run_local_kafka_no_docker.py`: Alternative to Docker for running the system with less resource usage. Supports command line options for customizing the run parameters.
- `scripts/start_kafka.sh`: Helper script for starting Kafka manually.
- `test_federated_learning.sh`: Script for testing the federated learning system.

## Features

- **Federated Averaging**: Implements the FedAvg algorithm to aggregate model updates from multiple clients.

- **Weight Compatibility**: Includes mechanisms to handle and adapt weights when there are minor architecture differences between server and client models.
- **Robust Communication**: Uses Kafka for reliable message passing between server and clients.
- **Model Serialization**: Efficient serialization and deserialization of model weights for transmission over Kafka.
- **Accuracy Evaluation**: Clients evaluate model performance on test data after training.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Includes a custom logging system with colored output and file logging.
- **Resource Optimization**: Includes options to reduce memory usage and optimize performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (Python 3.13 not supported)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for Docker-based deployment)
- Kafka
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- kafka-python

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have the required Python packages installed. You can use pip to install them:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run with Docker (Resource-Intensive but Simple)
You can run the entire system (Kafka, server, and clients) with a single Docker Compose command:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

This will start:
- A Kafka broker
- The federated learning server
- Multiple federated learning clients

### 3. Run Locally (Less Resource-Intensive)
For environments with limited resources, you can use the local script:

```bash
python run_local_kafka_no_docker.py
```

You can customize the run with command line options:

```bash
python run_local_kafka_no_docker.py --duration 30 --aggregation-interval 20 --training-interval 40 --num-clients 2
```

Available options:
- `--duration`: Duration in minutes to run the system (default: 30)
- `--aggregation-interval`: Interval in seconds between server aggregations (default: 30)
- `--min-updates`: Minimum updates required for aggregation (default: 1)
- `--training-interval`: Base interval in seconds between client training cycles (default: 60)
- `--num-clients`: Number of clients to start (default: 3)
- `--reduced-data`: Use reduced dataset size (default: True)

This script:
- Checks if Kafka is running locally
- Starts the server and multiple clients with optimized resource settings
- Uses environment variables to reduce memory usage

### 4. Run Individual Components (Optional)

If you want to run components separately:

#### Start Kafka
```bash
# Using Docker
docker compose up kafka

# Or using the script
./scripts/start_kafka.sh
```

#### Start the Server
```bash
python server.py
```

#### Start a Client
```bash
python client.py
```

You can run multiple instances of the client to simulate multiple clients in the federated learning setup.

## How It Works

### Federated Learning Process

1. **Initialization**: The server initializes a global model and publishes it to the `model_topic` Kafka topic.

2. **Client Training**: Each client:
   - Subscribes to the `model_topic` to receive the global model
   - Loads the CIFAR-10 dataset (or a subset) for training
   - Adapts the global model weights if necessary to match its local architecture
   - Trains the model on its local data for a specified number of epochs
   - Evaluates the model on local test data to measure accuracy
   - Sends the updated model weights to the `update_topic`

3. **Aggregation**: The server:
   - Collects model updates from clients via the `update_topic`
   - Performs federated averaging to create an updated global model
   - Publishes the new global model back to the `model_topic`

4. **Iteration**: Steps 2-3 repeat for multiple rounds to improve the global model.

5. **Evaluation**: After multiple rounds of training, clients evaluate the final model on test data.

### Weight Adaptation Mechanism

The system includes sophisticated mechanisms to handle cases where the model architecture might slightly differ between server and clients:

1. **Weight Compatibility Check**: Verifies if the received weights can be directly applied to the local model by comparing shapes and dimensions.

2. **Weight Adaptation**: When there's a mismatch (particularly in the flattened layer dimensions), the system attempts to adapt the weights by:
   - Analyzing the layer structure and identifying compatible layers
   - Padding or truncating weights as needed to fit the local model
   - Preserving as much learned information as possible

3. **Partial Update**: When only some layers are compatible, the system can apply partial updates to those layers while keeping other layers unchanged.

4. **Fallback Mechanism**: If adaptation isn't possible, the system can fall back to using a fresh model as a last resort.

### Serialization Process

The system uses an efficient serialization process to transmit model weights over Kafka:

1. **Weight Extraction**: Extracts numpy arrays from the TensorFlow model
2. **Binary Serialization**: Converts arrays to binary format with metadata
3. **Compression**: Optionally compresses the data to reduce message size
4. **Integrity Verification**: Includes checksums to verify data integrity
5. **Deserialization**: Reconstructs the original arrays on the receiving end

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The system supports several environment variables for configuration:

- `BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`: Kafka bootstrap servers (default: "localhost:9094")
- `CLIENT_ID`: ID for the client (default: randomly generated)

- `REDUCED_DATA_SIZE`: Set to "1" to use a smaller dataset for faster training (default: "0")
- `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL`: TensorFlow logging level (default: "2" for warnings only)

### Docker Configuration

- **Number of Clients**: Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to add or remove client services.
- **Memory Limits**: Adjust the memory limits in `docker-compose.yml` based on your system resources.
- **Volume Mounts**: Configure persistent storage for logs and data.

### Model and Training Configuration

- **Training Parameters**: Adjust batch size, learning rate, and other parameters in the client code.
- **Model Architecture**: Choose between the standard CNN and LeNet models in `common/model.py`. The system currently uses LeNet by default.
- **Number of Rounds**: Change the number of federated learning rounds in `server.py`.
- **Weight Adaptation**: The system includes enhanced weight adaptation mechanisms to handle different model architectures.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Kafka Connection Issues**:
   - Ensure Kafka is running and accessible. Check the bootstrap server address.
   - Verify that the required topics exist using `kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092`
   - Check Kafka logs for connection errors

2. **Weight Compatibility Errors**:
   - If you see errors about incompatible weights, check that the model architectures in server.py and client.py match exactly.
   - Check the model version in `common/model.py` to ensure all components are using the same version.

3. **Memory Issues**:
   - If you encounter memory problems with Docker, try reducing the memory limits in `docker-compose.yml`
   - Reduce the dataset size by setting `REDUCED_DATA_SIZE=1`
   - Use `run_local_kafka_no_docker.py` instead of Docker for a more resource-efficient setup

4. **TensorFlow Errors**:
   - If you see CUDA or GPU-related errors, try setting `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1` to force CPU-only mode
   - For version compatibility issues, check the exact TensorFlow version in `requirements.txt`

5. **Docker Issues**:
   - If Docker containers crash, check the logs with `docker logs <container_id>`
   - Increase the memory allocated to Docker in Docker Desktop settings
   - Try running components individually without Docker
